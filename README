Some Pioneer recievers have a web interface that allows you
to control various settings.  For example, you can change
the volume of your reciever by +0.5dB by sending a GET
request to:

http://<ipaddress>/EventHandler.asp?WebToHostItem=VU

The major problem with Pioneer's web interface is that it
isn't mobile friendly.  The goal of this is to make a web
application that is mobile friendly and offers the basic
functionality that I use most.

To run:

node volume.js

From a browser, go to:

http://<node ip>:3000/
